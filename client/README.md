# WCA Live Client

Built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)
and [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/).

## Setup

Requirements:

- Node.js

```shell
# Install npm dependencies.
npm install
```

## Development

```sh
# Start the client development server.
# It's responsible for quickly rebuilding
# the app when source files change.

Make sure to also start the API server.
